	band geometry	
	p_1 ----- p_3 ----- p_5 ----- p_7 ..... p_(2L-1) 
	|
	P_1 ----- P_2 ----- P_3 ----- P_4 ..... P_L
	|
	p_2 ----- p_4 ----- p_6 ----- p_8 ..... p_2L
	
	P_i = (X_i, Y_i, Z_i)	
	p_i = (x_i, y_i, z_i)	
	
	In my practice, I draw the band via patches like (p_1, p_2, p_4, p_3), (p_3, p_4, p_6, p_5) .....
	P_(2i-1), P_(2i) and p_i share same scalar value s_i 
	
	In case you want to adjust the width of band:
	p_1_new = P_1 + scalingFactor * (p_1-P_1);
	p_2_new = P_1 + scalingFactor * (p_2-P_1);

	"Cartesian" == needs to be smoothed
	"Unstructured" == no need to be smoothed
